This is a simple skeleton to use typescript and scss with webpack.

### To get the project running

Run `npm install` then `npm run build` then `npm run dev`

A development server should open at http://localhost:8080/

To stop the server just run CTRL+c and hit Y then enter in the command line.

### Changing Code

After the project is running, you can then change code in the src folder. Either the index.ts file or main.scss file. Any changes to these files will automatically rebuild the project and changes should be seen live in the browser.
